- energy_consumption[i]: The continuous energy it draws (kW/hour)  
- production_rate[i]: The units of product it produces per hour
- maintenance_interval[i]: Hours after which it requires 2-hour downtime

I have a total budget and maximum total_energy_limit. Goal: select machines to maximize production over T hours while respecting:
1. Total cost ‚â§ budget
