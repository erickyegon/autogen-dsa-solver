### 🎯 PROBLEM SHOWCASE (2:30 - 5:00)
**[Screen: Show complex scheduling problem on whiteboard/screen]**

**PROBLEM INTRODUCTION:**
"First, let me show you what we're building. Here's a real-world problem that stumps many developers:

'I have multiple tasks with start times, end times, and dependencies. I need to find the minimum number of workers to complete all tasks on schedule.'"

**COMPLEXITY EXPLANATION:**
"This is a classic scheduling optimization problem that combines:
- 📊 Graph theory (for dependencies)
- ⚡ Greedy algorithms (for optimization)  
- 🔄 Topological sorting (for task ordering)

Traditional approaches require deep algorithmic knowledge. But with our AI team, watch this..."

**[Demo the final working system - show input and AI collaboration]**

**AI CAPABILITIES PREVIEW:**
"The AI agents automatically:
1. 🧠 **Analyze** the problem type and complexity
2. 🔍 **Choose** the optimal algorithm approach  
3. 💻 **Generate** production-ready code
4. 🧪 **Test** with comprehensive test cases
5. 📊 **Explain** the solution and complexity

Now let's build this step by step!"
